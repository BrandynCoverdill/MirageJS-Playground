This is a playground to test around with the MirageJS library.

## What is Mirage JS?

Mirage JS is an API mocking library that lets you buil, test, and share a complete working JavaScript application without having to reply on any backend services.

Mirage JS works by intercepting a network request your JS app makes. It lets you mock the response, which enables you to develop an test your app as if you were interfacing with a live server.
